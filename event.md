The important sections are the `Start Publishing` and `Finish Publishing`

- Start Publishing: The date and time when the event will appear on the webpage. You can usually set this to the current date.
- Finish Publishing: The date when the even will remove itself from the website. I usually set this for the day after the event.

Once finished, you can click `Save & Close`

Then click `Search Tools`
